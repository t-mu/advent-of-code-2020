## Advent of code 2020
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020/) exercises made with [TypeScript](typescriptlang.org).

Working my way through the advent calendar by trying to approach each exercise with a TDD mindset.

Also leaving a trail of comments to describe my thinking, should anyone be interested in that.

Want to try it out locally?
1. `yarn install` - install dependencies
2. `yarn execute path/to/file` - run an exercise e.g. src/calendar1/calendar1.ts
3. `yarn test` - run tests
